# E-Commerce Store Project
This project provides the basic functionality of an e-commerce store developed using React JS, Redux Toolkit and TailwindCSS. Users can review products, add them to their carts, filter products and log in. The aim of the project is to learn how to use Redux Toolkit and better understand the Redux structure.
